Course structue: 

* 7 weeks - programming and software engineering
* 6 weeks - collaborative project 

```cpp
   // Your First C++ Program

  #include <iostream>

  int main() {
      std::cout << "Hello World!";
      return 0;
  }
```
   
## References and Pointers

- variables stored in memory, at a given **address**
- they *have* an **address** and *contain* a **value**



- a *reference* is a **supplementary name for a variable**
- syntax: `typeName& referenceName=variableName;`

```cpp
unsigned char i=165; // The variable i is stored at address 17
unsigned char& r=i; // r is just **another name** for i
```

- a *pointer* is a variable that **contains the address of another variable**
- syntax: `typeName* pointerName=&variableName;`

```cpp
unsigned char i=165; // The variable i is stored at address 17
unsigned char* r=&i; // The variable p contains the value 17, p is stored elsewhere
```

- p **points** to the variable i
- \*p **depoints** p

```cpp
unsigned char* p; // The variable p contains the address of i 
unsigned char *p; // The variable *p contains the value at the address p, so i
```

- you can do pointer arithmetics
- `p++;` adds the memory space of the object (moves to next object)


- A variable representing an array **"is" a pointer to the first element of the array**

```cpp
unsigned char i[10]; // i is a pointer to the first element
unsigned char* p=i; // p is equal to i
```
- p moves within the array (moves by memory length of `unsigned char`)

```cpp
*(p+4)=65; // affects 65 to the 5th element of the array
std::cout << i[4] << std:endl; // prints A (char corresponding to 65)
```
- when the program terminates, all allocated memory is cleared

## Tests

- Attention: `==` vs. `=`
```cpp
if(i==2){
    // enter if i is equal to 2
}
if(i=2){
    // i is now 2
    // 2 is converted to True, always enter statement
}
```

- `&&` : and
    - more efficiant than `&`
    - if first is `False`, doesn't test second
- `||` : or
- `=!` : not

## Loops
```cpp
// print "Hello" 10 times
for(int i=0; i<10;i++){
    std::out << "Hello" << std::endl;
}

// also prints "Hello" 10 times
int i = 0;
for(;;){
    if(i>= 10){break;}
    std::out << "Hello" << std::endl;
    i++;
}
```
- all statements are optional: `for(;;){}` is correct syntax
```cpp
while(condition_statement){
    //do something
}

do {
    //do something before testing condition
} while(condition_statement){
    //do something only if condition is true
}
```

## Functions
- Functions are used to **organize large programs**, and **avoid repetition**
- Structure 
    ```cpp
    returnTypeName functionName(arguments){
        statements
    }
    ```
- receives **zero or more arguments**
- has a **single return type** (may be `void`)
- When a function has to return something, the `return` keyword is used
- A function may **call other functions**, and even **call itself** ("recursive function")
- Two functions with the same name but different arguments **can co-exist**

Examples:
```cpp
double multiplyByTwo(double d){
    // receives one argument, a double called d
    double result = 2*d;
    return result;
    // this function prints nothing, but returns a double
}

double multiplyByTwo(double d){
    // In this case, the unnessecary temporary variable has been removed
    return 2*d;
}
```

- recursive functions bla bla bla

## Argument passing

- Functions may receive arguments **by value** or **by reference**
- When an argument is **passed by value, a copy of it is made**
    ```cpp
    void increment(int a){
        // i is a copy of the passed argument, even if it has the same name
        a++;
    }

    int main(){

        int i = 65;                     // affects 65 to i
        increment(i)                    // pass i by value to increment 
        std::cout << i << std:.endl;    // still prints 65

        return 0
    }
    ```
- When an argument is **passed by reference, it may be accessed by the function**
    ```cpp
    void increment(int& r){
        // r is a reference to the passed argument (not the &)
        r++;
    }

    int main(){

        int i = 65;                     // affects 65 to i
        increment(i)                    // pass i by reference to increment 
        std::cout << i << std:.endl;    // prints 66

        return 0
    }
    ```

## The stack

- second type of memory segment associated to an executable
- The stack is used for temporary memory storage:
    - variables declared in the function
    - arguments passed by value to functions
```cpp
int addToInteger(int& i, int increment) {

    int result=i+increment;
    return result;
}

int main() {

    int i= 65;                      // affects 65 to i
    i = addToInteger(i,2);          // add 2 to i
    std::cout << i << std::endl;    // prints 67

    return 0;
}
```
- How many variables stored in the stack? **3**
    - 2 declared in functions: `i` and `result`
    - 1 passed by value: `2`passed as an increment

## The heap

- third type of memory segment associated to an executable
- The heap is used to allocate memory that persists between functions
- in C++, the operator `new` is used to allocate on the heap
- in C++, the operator `delete` is used to de-allocate from the heap

```cpp
int main(){
    int* i = new int;     // i points to an int in the heap
    *i=65;                // affects 65 zo *i

    char* a=new char[10]; // a points to an array of chars in the heap
    a[4] = 'A';           // affects 'A' to the 5th element of the array

    delete i;             // free the memory pointed by i
    delete[] a;           // free the memory pointed by a

    return 0;
}
```
Who is on the stack? Who is in the heap?

- pointers `a` and `i` are in the stack
- values `65` and `'A'` affected to variables are in the heap

## SVN 

- Collaborative source-code writing tool 
    - One **central repository** created on a remote server
    - One **local repository** per developer
- Initially, a developer **checks out** the repository (i.e. makes their local copy)
- Then, the developer may:
    - **Modify** the code
    - **Update** their local repository based on the central repository
    - **Commit** their changes to the central repository
- Use tools with GUI to make it easier (e.g. TortoiseSVN / Pageant on Windows)

![Copy Modify Merge Solution](Images/CopyModifyMergeSolution.png)


SVN is a centralized version control system:

![Centralized Version Control](Images/CentralizedVersionControl.png)

## Git
<p>

Git is a distributed version control system:

![Distributed Version Control](Images/DistributedVersionControl.png)

- **Distributed version control system**
    - Everyone clones the **whole** repository (which contains the complete history)
    - The fact that one repository is seen as the main one (e.g. gitlab) is **artificial**
    - One has a **local** repository connected to one (or more) **remote** repositories
- **Two sets of communication demands**
    - Dealing with one's own **local repository**
        - &larr; **checkout**: from local repository to working copy
        - &rarr; **commit**: from working copy to local repository
    - Dealing with **remote repositories (a.k.a. syncing)**
        - &larr; **fetch**: obtain remote commits, but **marked as remote commits**
        - &larr; **pull**: fetch + merge branch into local branch
        - &rarr; **push**: from local repository to remote repository

<p>
Even with an artificially denoted "centralized" repository (such as github), Git makes it possible to communicate between "local" repositories

- Branches should be used **all the time**
    - For **developing new features**
    - For **preparing releases**
    - For **fixing bugs**
- Most branches are created temporarily , then merged and deleted
- For CSE201, within each project, there could be branches for "sub-projects"

## Classes

- Motivation: organize data and algorithms in large programs
- **Objects** are data structures that may contain
    - Data members
    - Member functions
- The word "**Class**" is used to mean "**Class of objects**"
    - All objects of the same class have the same structure
    - only **one class** with a given name, but **many objects** of the same class
- First, you define a class of objects, then you create objects of this class
- Fancy sentences:
    - "Object a is an **instance** of class A" (note the (arbitrary) capitalization)
    - "The **type** of 'a' is 'A'"
    
Examples:
```cpp
// Minimal class 
class A{                // 'class' keyword and class name
};                      // there has to be a ';' at the end

// A simple class
class A{
public:                 // Access (more on this later)
    int i;              // Data member
    void print() {      // Member function
        std::cout <<i << std::endl;
    }
};
```

Declaring a class means **making a new type** (like int, float, etc.)
```cpp
int i;      // The type of i is int
A a;        // The type of a is A
```

### Data members

- If a class has data members, then objects of this class **each have their own instances of these variables**
- In other words, an object "contains" data
```cpp 
A a;    // a has its own int i
A b;    // b has its own int i
A c;    // c has its own int i
```
Some memory has been allocated for each object and its variables. Which type? Answer: **on the stack**, as `new` has not been used.

- From **outside**, data members are accessed with `.`
```cpp
a.i = 10;                       // assigns 10 to i of a
std:: cout << a.i <<std::endl;  //outputs 10
```

- Data members **may be objects** (this is called **composition**)
```cpp
class A{
public: 
    int i;
};

class B{
public: 
    A a;
};

int main(){
    B b;
    b.a.i = 10;                         // assigns 10 to i of A
    std::cout << b.a.i << std::endl;    // outputs 10
    return 0;
}
```
- An object **cannot** contain itself

### Member functions

- Member functions **have access to data members**
```cpp
class A{
public:
    int i;
    void print(){               // This member function has access to data members
        std::cout << i <<std::endl;  // This i is the one belongiing to the objects
    }
};
```

- From **outside**, data members **and member functions** are accessed with `.`
```cpp
A a;
A b;

a.i = 10;   // assigns 10 to i of a
b.i = 17;   // assigns 17 to i of b

a.print();  // outputs 10
b.print();  // ouputs 17
```

- Member functions may also be used to **modify** data members
- Member functions may be **overloaded**
```cpp
class A{
public:
    int i;

    void add(int j) { i=i+j }           // Overloaded functions
    void add(int j, int k) { i=i+j+k }  // Overloaded functions
    void print() { std::cout << i <<std::endl; }
};
```

### Access modifiers

- Access modifiers are used to specify **who** can access data and functions
    - `public`: anyone outside the class has access
    - `private`: nobody outside the class has access
    - (more on a third modifier later)
- Modifiers may be used in **zero or more places**
    - **If no modifier is specified, everything is private**

```cpp
class A{
public:     // A public interface is used to acess data
    void setI(int a) { i=a; }
    int getI() { return i; }
private:    // Implementation details are hidden from clients/users
    int i;
};
```

### This

- In each class, there is a **reserved** (hidden but usable) Variable called `this`
- If the class name is **A**, the type of `this` is **A\*** (pointer to an object of the class)
- The (constant) value of `this` is **the address of the object**
```cpp
int main(){
    A a;
    a.setI(10);
};
```
Versus:
```cpp 
int main(){
    A* a = new a;
    a->setI(10);
};
```

- `this` may be used when there is an ambiguity between a data member and a member function argument (if `this` is ommitted, the argument has priority)
```cpp 
class A{
public:
    // WRONG:
    void setI(int i) { i=i; } // i will not be changed

    // instead use:
    void setI(int i) { (*this).i = i; }
    // OR
    void setI(int i) { this->i = i; }

    void print() { std::cout <<i <<std::endl;} // Here, "this" is not neccessary    
```

### Constructors and destructors

#### Constructors 

- Constructors are **special member functions**
    - They have the **same name as the class**
    - They have **no return type** (not even void)
- Constructors are used to initialize ("construct") objects
```cpp
class A{
public:
    A() {       // constructor
        i=0;
    }
    int i;
};
```

- Constructors are called automatically the first time objects are declared
```cpp 
A a;        // The constructor A() is called
```

- As other functions, constructors may have parameters
```cpp
class A{
public:
    A()       { i=0; } // default constructor
    A(int a)  { i=a; } // ninja constructor

    int i;
}; 
```

- Using non-default constructors may be used to simplify code
- the compiler automatically determines which contructor to call, **based on the arguments types**
- If you program **no** constructors, the compiler makes a default one for you
    - (no guarantee on what it does though)
    - On some compulers it doesn't even compile

#### Destructors

- Destructors are **special member functions**
    - They have the **same name as the class, preceded with ~ (tilde)**
    - They have **no return type**
- Destructors are **called just before the object memory is released**
- Destructors are typically **used to clean up memory**
```cpp
class A{
public:
    int* i; 
    // The i of a (a.i) is on the stack (since a is on the stack)

    A()   { i = new int[10]; } // the array is on the heap! 
    // Since we use "new"
    // even though i of a, on the stack, contains its address

    ~A()  { delete [] i; }
};

int main() {
    A a; // A() is called
    // a is on the stack

    for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
        // i is on the stack
        std::cout<<a.i[i]<< std::endl;
    }
     return 0;
} // ~A() is called
```

- there can be at most **one** destructor per class
- A destructor cannot take any arguments
- If no destructor is programmed, one is automatically written for you
- Beware of **memory leaks (=memory that cannot be deleted anymore)**

## Organizing files

- For large projects, **class declarations** are separated from **class definitions**
- One **header file** (e.g. `A.hpp`) and one **course file (e.g.`A.cpp`) per class (e.g. A)

**Header file: `A.hpp`**
```cpp
#pragma once

class A {
public:
    A();
    ~A();
    int getI();
    void setI(int i);

private:
    int i;
};
```

**Source file: `A.cpp`** 
```cpp
#include "A.hpp"

A::A() { i=0; }

A::~A() { i=0; }

int A::getI() { return i;}
void A::setI() { this->i=i;}
```
**Member function definition syntax:**  
`returnType className::functionName(arguments) { statements... }`

Including one class in another:

**Header file: `B.hpp`**
```cpp
#pragma once

#include "A.hpp"

class B {
public:
    B();
    ~B();
    A getA();
    void setA(A a);

private:
    A a;
};
```

**Source file: `B.cpp`**
```cpp 
#include "B.hpp" // No need to include A.hpp (it is included by B.hpp)

A B::getA() { return a; }
void B::setA(A a) { this->a = a; }
```
